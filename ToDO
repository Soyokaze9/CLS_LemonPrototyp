- make dataGenerator for Data > 1D
- implement lower boundary
- improve GraphCreation 
- remove iterations boundary
- make modular, oo-conforming: 
	- make centerID and isCenter set through singular setter
- maybe better use Unit Tests?
- visualization/presentation of calculated clusters of general data

- ensure performance
	- check memory address of int[]s regions
	- write new visualization (using blocks)
	- reuse graph when swapping
	- reuse part of flow calcs?
	
- ensure correctness:
	- check calcCostCS againts bruteforce for sizeable examples
			
- later reinterpret clustered data
